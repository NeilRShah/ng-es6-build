# AngularJS ES6 + LESS Build Process with Webpack and Django Backend

This is a demonstration of how to build an AngularJS 1.x client-side app, written using ES6 syntax. The app is served by a Django backend.

The build process uses Webpack to translate and bundle the ES6 modules as a single ES5 file for browser compatibility. Webpack also handles loading component html templates and LESS CSS preprocessing. CSS is placed in a separate file from the JavaScript.
